Hello,

This is a simple commandline calculator. It should be able to use paranthesis, power to, multiplication, addition, division and subtractraction. It only supports single paranthesis and not any nested. Might come with an update at some point.

Please, feel free to use clone and ripp the code to your hearts delight. If anyone has any impo=rovements or better solutions please let me know.

Best regards, Chris
